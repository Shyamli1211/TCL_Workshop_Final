# 🧾 TCL Workshop — From Basic to Advanced in VLSI  

## 🔰 Introduction  
This repository documents my learnings from the **VSD TCL Workshop**, designed to strengthen scripting skills for automation in the VLSI domain.  
Throughout the sessions, I learned how TCL can simplify design tool interactions, automate tasks, and create efficient workflows used in the semiconductor industry.
