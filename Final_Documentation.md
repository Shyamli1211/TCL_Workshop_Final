# 🧾 TCL Workshop — Detailed Documentation  

## 🔰 Introduction  
This documentation is based on the **TCL Workshop — From Basic to Advanced in VLSI**.  
The workshop was designed to help participants understand the role of **TCL scripting** in the automation of EDA tools used in the VLSI domain.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To gain hands-on knowledge of TCL commands and syntax  
- To automate design flows and tool setups  
- To understand how TCL integrates into EDA tools  
- To practice real-time examples related to timing analysis, constraint setup, and report generation
